This provides a larger dataset for training and enables a model to encounter more diverse features. The augmented data helps the model better generalize to unseen data and improve its overall performance in real-world environments.\n","\n","- Reduced data dependency\n","\n","  Data augmentation is a useful technology in medical imaging because it helps improve diagnostic models that detect, recognize, and diagnose diseases based on images. The creation of an augmented image provides more training data for models, especially for rare diseases that lack source data variations. The production and use of synthetic patient data advances medical research while respecting all data privacy considerations.\n","\n","- Mitigate overfitting in training data\n","\n","  Overfitting is the undesirable ML behavior where a model can accurately provide predictions for training data but it struggles with new data. In contrast, data augmentation provides a much larger and more comprehensive dataset for model training. It makes training sets appear unique to deep neural networks, preventing them from learning to work with only specific characteristics.\n","\n","Data augmentation is a central technique in computer vision tasks. It helps create diverse data representations and tackle class imbalances in a training dataset.\n","\n","The first usage of augmentation in computer vision is through position augmentation. This strategy crops, flips, or rotates an input image to create augmented images. Cropping either resizes the image or crops a small part of the original image to create a new one. Rotation, flip, and resizing transformation all alter the original randomly with a given probability of providing new images.\n","\n","Another usage of augmentation in computer vision is in color augmentation. This strategy adjusts the elementary factors of a training image, such as its brightness, contrast degree, or saturation. These common image transformations change the hue, dark and light balance, and separation between an image's darkest and lightest areas to create augmented images.\n","\n","<img src='https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:850/1*ae1tW5ngf1zhPRyh7aaM1Q.png'>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qb5HEWKobwSV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Image processing libraries"],"metadata":{"id":"DA6wOuTgURIH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The following task, since there is so many images to load, is deciding which python image processing library to pick for the fastest loading.\n","\n","[This article](https://learnopencv.com/efficient-image-loading/) details benchmarking code to compare the 2 most popular image processing libraries in python (Pillow and OpenCV), one of their optimization fork (Pillow-SIMD) and a fourth optimized jpeg-specialized one (TurboJPEG).\n","\n","As we can see from its results, TurboJPEG is the most efficient library and is specialized in the .jpeg format which we use, making it the perfect choice.\n","\n","<img src='https://learnopencv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mean-median-rgb.png'>"],"metadata":{"id":"j45_Iq2y_u5I"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Code"],"metadata":{"id":"fqinB4ZAUpS9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from PIL import Image\n","import os\n","\n","sets = [\"train\", \"val\", \"test\"]\n","types = [\"PNEUMONIA\", \"NORMAL\"]\n","images = {}\n","for set_name in sets:\n","    images[f\"{set_name}_normal\"] = []\n","    images[f\"{set_name}_bacteria\"] = []\n","    images[f\"{set_name}_virus\"] = []\n","lowest_width, lowest_height, highest_width, highest_height = float('inf'), float('inf'), 0, 0\n","\n","print(f\"loading images from {base_dir}\")\n","size = 0\n","for set_name in sets:\n","    for type_name in types:\n","        path = os.path.join(base_dir, set_name, type_name)\n","        for filename in os.listdir(path):\n","            if filename.endswith(\".jpeg\"):\n","                with Image.open(os.path.join(path, filename)) as image:\n","                    width, height = image.size\n","                    size += width * height * (1 if image.mode == \"L\" else 3)\n","                    lowest_width = min(lowest_width, width)\n","                    lowest_height = min(lowest_height, height)\n","                    highest_width = max(highest_width, width)\n","                    highest_height = max(highest_height, height)\n","                    image.load()\n","                    if \"bacteria\" in filename:\n","                        images[f\"{set_name}_bacteria\"].append(image)\n","                    elif \"virus\" in filename:\n","                        images[f\"{set_name}_virus\"].append(image)\n","                    else:\n","                        images[f\"{set_name}_normal\"].append(image)\n","print(size)\n","total = 0\n","for set_type in images:\n","    print(f\"{set_type}: {len(images[set_type])} images loaded\")\n","    total += len(images[set_type])\n","print(f\"total: {total} images loaded\")\n","print(f\"lowest width: {lowest_width}\")\n","print(f\"highest width: {highest_width}\")\n","print(f\"lowest height: {lowest_height}\")\n","print(f\"highest height: {highest_height}\")"],"metadata":{"id":"0XNbM8HomB_v","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715588621358,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":366833,"user":{"displayName":"Baptiste Lemonnier","userId":"06095563635647499760"}},"outputId":"081fa70f-8f07-46a5-fa91-4b0f31e5c537"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["loading images from /content/drive/MyDrive/ZoidBerg2.0 - T-Dev-810/chest_Xray\n","8505428617\n","train_normal: 1341 images loaded\n","train_bacteria: 2530 images loaded\n","train_virus: 1345 images loaded\n","val_normal: 8 images loaded\n","val_bacteria: 8 images loaded\n","val_virus: 0 images loaded\n","test_normal: 234 images loaded\n","test_bacteria: 242 images loaded\n","test_virus: 148 images loaded\n","total: 5856 images loaded\n","lowest width: 384\n","highest width: 2916\n","lowest height: 127\n","highest height: 2713\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Convolutional Neural Networks"],"metadata":{"id":"1gJCVv-c86hZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["[Convolutional Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNNs) are a class of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) algorithms that are particularly effective for image analysis tasks, making them ideal for pneumonia recognition in radiographic images:\n","\n","- Feature Learning: Traditional image processing techniques require manual extraction of features. CNNs can automatically learn and extract features from images, which is beneficial in medical imaging where defining what constitutes a feature can be complex.\n","\n","- Hierarchical Pattern Recognition: CNNs work by recognizing patterns in a hierarchical manner.

Common pooling operations include **max pooling and average pooling**.\n","- Upsampling Layers:\n","\n","  Upsampling layers are used to increase the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This helps in recovering the spatial information lost during downsampling and enables the network to produce segmentation maps with the same resolution as the input image.\n","- Avoidance of Dense Layers:\n","\n","  Unlike traditional neural network architectures, FCNs avoid using dense (fully connected) layers. Dense layers would require a fixed-size input, which is not suitable for segmentation tasks where the input image can have varying dimensions. By using only convolutional and upsampling layers, FCNs can handle images of different sizes efficiently.\n","- Locally Connected Layers:\n","\n","  FCNs only use locally connected layers, meaning each output feature depends only on a small region of the input image. This property allows FCNs to **handle images of different sizes without the need for resizing or cropping**.\n","- Downsampling Path and Upsampling Path:\n","\n","  FCNs are typically structured with a downsampling path and an upsampling path. The downsampling path, often composed of convolutional and pooling layers, captures the context and global information of the input image. The upsampling path, composed of upsampling and convolutional layers, helps in localizing objects by gradually increasing the spatial resolution of the feature maps.\n","- Skip Connections:\n","\n","  Skip connections are connections between layers at the same spatial resolution in the downsampling and upsampling paths. These connections help preserve fine details and spatial information that may be lost during downsampling. By combining features from different resolutions, skip connections improve the segmentation accuracy of FCNs.\n","\n","In summary, FCNs are tailored for semantic segmentation tasks, leveraging convolutional layers, pooling, and upsampling while avoiding dense layers.
